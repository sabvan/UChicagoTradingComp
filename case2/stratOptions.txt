1. RL 
2. Markov Chains
3. Markowitz optimization


Rl method
 - states are different weights 
 - rewards are based on return, risk, and Sharpe ratio
 - 

Markov Chains?
 - model transitions between returns
 - each state represents a particular market 
 - learn probabilities
 - if predict a transition to a different market regime, can rebalance portfolios

Markowitz:
 - minimize wC^tw
 - calculate efficient frontier weights using quadratic programming

Sharpe Ratio Maximization
 - use monte carlo simulation to find to best weights
 - might take too long?

projectsion onto Laplace distribution
 - rather than on normal, you laplace that captures heavty tailed asset returns
 - estimate parameters from there than optimize further


run model on new data!!
